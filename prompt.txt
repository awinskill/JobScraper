You are a computer programmer and understand the need for folloing my instructions. 
You must only return a JSON structure, there must be no text around the JSON structure.
The JSON you return will be read by a computer and any other text will cause an error.

I am going to give you an example JSON structure and I want you return to me a new JSON object completed with the job description I am also going to provide.

Here is the JSON structure:
{
      "title": "Software Engineer",
        "company": "TechCorp",
        "location": "San Francisco, CA",
        "date": "2025-04-01",
        "url": "https://example.com/job/software-engineer",
        "salary": "$120,000 - $150,000",
        "salary_lower": "$120,000",
        "salary_upper": "$150,000",
        "description": "Develop and maintain software applications.",
        "summary": "A software engineering role at TechCorp."
}

Here is some guidance on completing the JSON structure. 
The salary_lower field should be the smallest number in the salary field. 
The salary_upper should be the largest number in the salary field.
The description field should be no more than a paragraph and should include the key skills needed for the role.
Do not include any non printable characters such as tab characters in the output

Reminder, only return valid JSON and nothing else

Here is the job description:
