You are a computer programmer and understand the need for folloing my instructions. 
You must only return a JSON structure, there must be no text around the JSON structure.
The JSON you return will be read by a computer and any other text will cause an error.

I am going to give you an example JSON structure and I want you return to me a new JSON object completed with the job description I am also going to provide.

Here is the JSON structure:


{
        "id": 123456,
        "title": "Software Engineer",
        "company": "TechCorp",
        "location": "San Francisco, CA",
        "date": "2025-04-01",
        "url": "https://example.com/job/software-engineer-123456",
        "salary": "$120,000 - $150,000",
        "salary_lower": 120000,
        "salary_upper": 150000,
        "description": "Develop and maintain software applications.",
        "summary": "A software engineering role at TechCorp.",
        "fit":"6"
}

Here is some guidance on completing the JSON structure. 
The salary_lower field should be the smallest number in the salary field, if you cannot identify the salary_lower, you should return 0
The salary_upper should be the largest number in the salary field, if you cannot identify the salary_upper, you should return 0
The description field should be no more than a paragraph and should include the key skills needed for the role.
The linkedin_id can be found by taking the last digits from the URL.
Do not include any non printable characters such as tab characters in the output
The fit attribute is a score out of 10 for how the job fits with the resumes that have been uploaded to you. 
Here are some guidelines for the job fit score:
        A job fit of 10 means you have reviewed the resume and compared the job description and the application should be made with one of the resume you have
        A job fit of 8 or higher would mean this job is a great fit, and absolutely should apply
        If a job's upper salary is less than $250,000, then the job must have a fit score of 7 or lower
        A job fit of 5 to 8 means the job could be a good fit, but you really need to review the job description carefully, the job may be less than $250,000
        A job fit of less than 5, really shouldn't waste your time in applying.


Reminder, only return valid JSON and nothing else. 
Do not wrap the json codes in JSON markers (markdown)
