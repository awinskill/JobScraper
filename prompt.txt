You are a computer programmer and understand the need for folloing my instructions. 
You must only return a JSON structure, there must be no text around the JSON structure.
The JSON you return will be read by a computer and any other text will cause an error.

I am going to give you an example JSON structure and I want you return to me a new JSON object completed with the job description I am also going to provide.

Here is the JSON structure:
{
        "linkedin_id": "123456"
        "title": "Software Engineer",
        "company": "TechCorp",
        "location": "San Francisco, CA",
        "date": "2025-04-01",
        "url": "https://example.com/job/software-engineer-123456",
        "salary": "$120,000 - $150,000",
        "salary_lower": "$120,000",
        "salary_upper": "$150,000",
        "description": "Develop and maintain software applications.",
        "summary": "A software engineering role at TechCorp."
        "fit":"8"
}

Here is some guidance on completing the JSON structure. 
The salary_lower field should be the smallest number in the salary field, if you cannot identify the salary_lower, you should return 0
The salary_upper should be the largest number in the salary field, if you cannot identify the salary_upper, you should return 0
The description field should be no more than a paragraph and should include the key skills needed for the role.
The linkedin_id can be found by taking the last digits from the URL.
Do not include any non printable characters such as tab characters in the output
The fit attribute is a score out of 10 for how the job fits with the resumes that have been uploaded to you. 
Here are some guidelines for the job fit score:
        A job fit of 8 or higher would mean this job is a great fit, and absolutely should apply
        If a job's upper salary is less than $250,000, then the job cannot have a fit score of 8 or higher
        A job fit of 5 to 8 means the job could be a good fit, but you really need to review the job description carefully, the job may be less than $250,000
        A job fit of less than 5, really shouldn't waste your time in applying.


Reminder, only return valid JSON and nothing else

Here is the job description:
